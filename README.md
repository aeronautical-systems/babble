# babble

[Babble](https://gitlab.com/irlaender/babble) is a simple package for natural
language understanding (NLU).

## Features

* Rule based intent recognition
* Simple fuzzy machting of classifiers using levenshtein distance.

## Usage

Install babble.

        git checkout https://gitlab.com/irlaender/babble.git
        cd babble
        pip install -e .

### Cli

Use babble as cli:

        babble --domain path/to/domain.json "Hello Word"

### Lib

Use babble as lib:

        from babble.engine import Engine
        
        engine = Engine(path_to_domain_config="/path/to/domain.json")
        understanding = engine.evaluate("Hello World")
        if understanding:
            print(understanding.as_dict())
        else:
            print("Not understood")

## Configuration

Babble needs to be configured by setting up its *domain*. The domain
configuration is a JSON file and contains all *intentions* and rules with
classifiers. Rules can be written using a easy but limited grammar.

* alternatives ->  ``foo|bar|baz``
* substitutions -> ``foo:bar``
* tagging -> ``foo{bar}``

Here is a example of domain configuration:

    [
        {
            "type": "intent",
            "name": "set_timer",
            "rule": "set timer <number> <unit>"
        },
        {
            "type": "entity",
            "name": "unit",
            "rule": "minutes|minute|hours|hour"
        },
        {
            "type": "entity",
            "name": "number",
            "rule": "zero|one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|((nine|niner):niner){value}"
        }
        ]

A Intention has a name and a rule. The rule is sequence of *classifiers*. A
classifier can be either a simple word or a reference to a *\<entity\>*. A entity
allows to define  more complicated rules for the classifier.

The intention recognition follows a simple rule:
Given a phrase, the intention is found when all classifiers can be
found in exact in the order as defined in rule of the intention.

## Example Result

Let's say we are using the domain from above and want to get the intention of
the following phrase: *set my fucking timer to nine hours*. This would be the
result:

        {
            "input": "set my fucking timer to nine hours",
            "intent": "set_timer",
            "slots": [
                {
                    "name": "set",
                    "value": "set",
                },
                {
                    "name": "timer",
                    "value": "timer"
                },
                {
                    "name": "number",
                    "value": "four",
                    "tag": "value"
                },
                {
                    "name": "unit",
                    "value": "hour"
                }
            ],
            "processed": "set timer niner hours"
        }

Awesome!
